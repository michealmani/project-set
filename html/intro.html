    <h1>Introduction:</h1>
    <div class="sub-div"> 
     <p>Java is a <b>programming language and a platform. </b><br>Java is a high level, robust, object-oriented and secure programming language.
           <br> Java was developed by Sun Microsystems (which is now the subsidiary of Oracle) in the year 1995. <br>James Gosling is known as the father of Java. Before Java, its name was Oak. Since Oak was already a registered company, so James Gosling and his team changed the name from Oak to Java.
            <b>Platform:</b> Any hardware or software environment in which a program runs, is known as a platform. Since Java has a runtime environment (JRE) and API, it is called a platform.

    <h1>History of java:</h1>
    <div class="sub-div2">
        <p>The history of Java starts with the <b>Green Team.</b> Java team members (also known as Green Team), initiated this project to develop a language for digital devices such as set-top boxes, televisions, etc. However, it was best suited for internet programming. Later, Java technology was incorporated by Netscape.
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Gosling">James Gosling</a>, Mike Sheridan, and Patrick Naughton initiated the Java language project in June 1991. The small team of sun engineers called Green Team.
           Firstly, it was called <b>"Greentalk"</b> by James Gosling, and the file extension was .gt.
           After that, it was called Oak and was developed as a part of the Green project.
            Java is an island in Indonesia where the first coffee was produced (called Java coffee). It is a kind of espresso bean.
           It is used for:<br><br>
           •	Mobile applications (specially Android apps)<br>
           •	Desktop applications<br>
           •	Web applications<br>
           •	Web servers and application servers<br>
           •	Games<br>
           •	Database connection<br>
           </p>

    <h1>  Why Use Java?:</h1>
    <div class="sub-div">
      
•	Java works on different platforms (Windows, Mac, Linux, Raspberry Pi, etc.)
•	It is one of the most popular programming language in the world
•	It is easy to learn and simple to use
•	It is open-source and free
•	It is secure, fast and powerful
•	Java is an object oriented language which gives a clear structure to programs and allows code to be reused, lowering development costs
•	As Java is close to C++ and C#, it makes it easy for programmers to switch to Java or vice versa

    <h1>  JVM:</h1>
  <div class="sub-div">
JVM (Java Virtual Machine) is an abstract machine. It is called a virtual machine because it doesn't physically exist. It is a specification that provides a runtime environment in which Java bytecode can be executed. It can also run those programs which are written in other languages and compiled to Java bytecode.
The JVM performs the following main tasks:
o	Loads code
o	Verifies code
o	Executes code
o	Provides runtime environment
