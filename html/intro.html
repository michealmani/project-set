                <h1>Introduction:</h1>
                <p>Java is a <b>programming language and a platform. </b><br>Java is a high level, robust,
                    object-oriented and secure programming language.
                    <br> Java was developed by Sun Microsystems (which is now the subsidiary of Oracle) in the year
                    1995. <br>James Gosling is known as the father of Java. Before Java, its name was Oak. Since Oak was
                    already a registered company, so James Gosling and his team changed the name from Oak to Java.
                    <b>Platform:</b> Any hardware or software environment in which a program runs, is known as a
                    platform. Since Java has a runtime environment (JRE) and API, it is called a platform.

            <h1>History of java:</h1>
            <p>The history of Java starts with the <b>Green Team.</b> Java team members (also known as Green Team),
                initiated this project to develop a language for digital devices such as set-top boxes, televisions,
                etc. However, it was best suited for internet programming. Later, Java technology was incorporated by
                Netscape.
                <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Gosling">James Gosling</a>, Mike Sheridan, and Patrick
                Naughton initiated the Java language project in June 1991. The small team of sun engineers called Green
                Team.
                Firstly, it was called <b>"Greentalk"</b> by James Gosling, and the file extension was .gt.
                After that, it was called Oak and was developed as a part of the Green project.
                Java is an island in Indonesia where the first coffee was produced (called Java coffee). It is a kind of
                espresso bean.
                It is used for:<br><br>
                • Mobile applications (specially Android apps)<br>
                • Desktop applications<br>
                • Web applications<br>
                • Web servers and application servers<br>
                • Games<br>
                • Database connection<br>
            </p>

            <h1> Why Use Java?:</h1>
            • Java works on different platforms (Windows, Mac, Linux, Raspberry Pi, etc.)<br>
            • It is one of the most popular programming language in the world<br>
            • It is easy to learn and simple to use<br>
            • It is open-source and free<br>
            • It is secure, fast and powerful<br>
            • Java is an object oriented language which gives a clear structure to programs and allows code to be
            reused, lowering development costs<br>
            • As Java is close to C++ and C#, it makes it easy for programmers to switch to Java or vice versa<br>

            <h1> JVM:</h1>
            JVM (Java Virtual Machine) is an abstract machine. It is called a virtual machine because it doesn't
            physically exist. It is a specification that provides a runtime environment in which Java bytecode can be
            executed. It can also run those programs which are written in other languages and compiled to Java bytecode.
            The JVM performs the following main tasks:<br>
            o Loads code<br>
            o Verifies code<br>
            o Executes code<br>
            o Provides runtime environment<br>
            <h1>JRE:</h1>
            JRE is an acronym for Java Runtime Environment. It is also written as Java RTE. The Java Runtime Environment
            is a set of software tools which are used for developing Java applications. It is used to provide the
            runtime environment. It is the implementation of JVM. It physically exists. It contains a set of libraries +
            other files that JVM uses at runtime.<br>
            <h1>JDK:</h1>
            JDK is an acronym for Java Development Kit. The Java Development Kit (JDK) is a software development
            environment which is used to develop Java applications and applets. It physically exists. It contains JRE +
            development tools.<br>
            <h5>Sample program:</h5>
            <code>
                class Main<br>
 {<br>
  public static void main(String[] args) <br>
{<br>
    System.out.println("Hello World");<br>
}<br>
 }<br>

            </code>
            Every line of code that runs in Java must be inside a class.
            Any code inside the<mark> main()</mark> method will be executed<mark>
                println()</mark> method to print a line of text to the screen
