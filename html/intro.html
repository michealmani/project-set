     <p>Java is a <b>programming language and a platform. </b><br>Java is a high level, robust, object-oriented and secure programming language.
           <br> Java was developed by Sun Microsystems (which is now the subsidiary of Oracle) in the year 1995. <br>James Gosling is known as the father of Java. Before Java, its name was Oak. Since Oak was already a registered company, so James Gosling and his team changed the name from Oak to Java.
            <b>Platform:</b> Any hardware or software environment in which a program runs, is known as a platform. Since Java has a runtime environment (JRE) and API, it is called a platform.

           After that, it was called Oak and was developed as a part of the Green project.
